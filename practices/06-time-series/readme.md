## Overview


In this module, we'll explore the intricacies of working with dates and times in data analysis. Dates and times play an essential role in a wide range of datasets, and understanding how to manipulate, visualize, and derive insights from them is crucial. Using the Air Quality dataset from the UCI Machine Learning repository, we will delve into various techniques that will help in the preprocessing and analysis of such data.

## Core Concepts

Parsing Dates: Before any form of time series analysis, we need to recognize and convert date strings into actual date objects that Python can understand and manipulate.

Cleaning up Data: Real-world data is often messy. We'll learn how to identify missing or inconsistent data and deal with it effectively.

Fixing "Numerical" Strings: At times, numbers might be read as strings, especially when they contain symbols like commas for decimals. We'll fix these to ensure proper numerical analysis.

Making Functions: Encapsulate repetitive tasks into functions. This makes our code more readable and reusable.

Timezones: Time zones can be tricky but are crucial when dealing with global datasets. We'll understand how to localize and convert between different time zones.

Resampling: Convert your time series data to different frequencies, e.g., from hourly to daily data.

Rolling Operations: Smooth out time series data or calculate metrics on a rolling window, like moving averages.

Plotting: Visual representation can help in understanding patterns over time, detecting outliers, and identifying trends.

### **Exercises**

1. **Date Detection:** The Air Quality dataset might have date strings in various formats. Identify and list down all the unique date formats you can find.

2. **Fill the Gaps:** Using the Air Quality dataset, find days where data might be missing completely. Propose a strategy to fill in these gaps using interpolation or any other technique you've learned.

3. **Timezone Mastery:** Assume the Air Quality dataset's timestamps are in Central European Time (CET). Convert these timestamps into Eastern Standard Time (EST) and Pacific Standard Time (PST).

4. **Downsampling Data:** The dataset might have hourly recordings of pollutant levels. Convert this to give bi-daily (every 48 hours) maxima and minima for each pollutant.

5. **Rolling Insights:** Compute a 5-day rolling median for the ozone levels in the dataset. Visualize this alongside the actual values to identify patterns or anomalies.

6. **Seasonal Visualization:** Using the dataset, plot the quarterly (every 3 months) averages of CO (carbon monoxide) levels. Can you identify any seasonal patterns or trends?
