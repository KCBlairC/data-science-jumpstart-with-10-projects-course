# Practice Exercises for Analyzing and Visualizing SQL Database Data

## Overview

In this section, you'll have a chance to practice the concepts you've learned about analyzing and visualizing data from a SQL database. Start by reviewing the core concepts covered to ensure you understand them. Then, proceed to the exercises below. Remember, these exercises are for your own understanding and growth, so attempt them as best as you can.

## Core concepts

### Connecting to a SQL Database

To interact with a SQL database using Python, you can use several libraries such as `sqlite3` or SQLAlchemy's `create_engine`.

### Querying the Database

This involves writing SQL queries to fetch data from the database. This data can then be used in Python for further analysis or visualization.

### Using Pandas with SQL

Pandas provides methods like `read_sql` to directly load data from a SQL query into a DataFrame. 

### Manipulating and Describing Data

After fetching the data, it's common to describe or manipulate it using pandas functionalities. Examples include using `describe()` to get a statistical summary or using `groupby()` for aggregations.

### Visualizing Data

Once you have the desired data, you can visualize it using plotting libraries like `matplotlib`.

## Exercises

1. **Database Setup**: Using a different dataset, create a SQL database and upload your data into it. Ensure the data is properly formatted and the table is appropriately structured.
   
2. **Basic Querying**: Write a query that fetches the first 10 records of your database. Display this using pandas.

3. **Advanced Querying**: Based on the dataset you have chosen, come up with a more complex query. This might involve filtering data, joining tables, or computing aggregated metrics.

4. **Statistics from SQL**: Instead of using pandas `describe()`, try writing a SQL query that returns similar statistical metrics (count, mean, min, max, etc.) for a column of your choice.

5. **Visualization**: Using data from a query, visualize a trend or distribution in your dataset. For example, if your dataset has a date column, plot a metric's monthly average over time.

6. **Datetime Manipulations**: If your dataset contains datetime information, practice converting these to appropriate datetime formats and time zones using pandas.

7. **Custom SQL Functions**: As demonstrated with the `STD` class in the sample, write a custom SQL aggregate function to compute a metric of your choice. This might be a different measure of spread, a growth rate, or something domain-specific based on your dataset.

8. **Optimization**: SQL queries can sometimes be slow or resource-intensive, especially when processing large datasets. Try optimizing one of your previous queries. For example, can you find a more efficient way to calculate standard deviation in SQL, as demonstrated in the sample?

9. **Reflection**: Compare the results of your SQL-based statistical computations with those from equivalent pandas operations. Do they match? If there are discrepancies, can you identify why?

10. **Extra Practice**: The provided code contained some additional complexities, such as dealing with `NULL` values, using `NULLIF` for avoiding division by zero, and more. Try introducing similar complexities in your exercises, either by modifying your dataset or your queries.

After you've attempted these exercises, you should have a stronger grasp on how to use Python, SQL, and pandas for data analysis and visualization tasks.
