# Data Science Course Exercises

We encourage you to work on the exercises. Please [see the instructions](https://github.com/talkpython/data-science-jumpstart-with-10-projects-course#instructions) for launching and running code in notebooks.  

We have also added GitHub [discussion forums](https://github.com/talkpython/data-science-jumpstart-with-10-projects-course/discussions) to this repo. Feel free to post your thoughts there while working on these and taking the course.
