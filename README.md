Data Science Jumpstart with 10 Projects Course

## Instructions

You can run the notebook using:

* Codespaces
* Locally

## Running in GitHub Codespaces

You can use GitHub Codespaces to run this codebase in a fully configured, cloud-hosted development environment:

1. Click the green "Code" button on the main repository page.

2. Click "Open with Codespaces" and "New codespace."

3. Open up `notebooks/01-StudentData.ipynb'



## Running Locally
To run this codebase locally, you'll need to set up a Python virtual environment and install the necessary packages. Follow these steps:

1. Ensure you have Python installed on your system. If not, you can download it from [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

2. Clone this repository into your local machine using the terminal (Mac), CMD (Windows), or a GUI tool like SourceTree.

3. Navigate to the repository folder via your terminal.

4. Create a virtual environment. You can do this by running:
    ```
    python -m venv env
    ```
    This will create a new Python virtual environment in a folder named `env`.

5. Activate the virtual environment. On macOS and Linux, run:
    ```
    source env/bin/activate
    ```
    On Windows, run:
    ```
    .\env\Scripts\activate
    ```

6. Install the necessary packages using pip by running:
    ```
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
    This will install all the packages listed in `requirements.txt` to your virtual environment.

7. Launch jupyter
   ```
   jupyter lab
   ```
   
8.  Open up `notebooks/01-StudentData.ipynb'
